This folder contains transcoding files between slp1 and roman,
where svarita accent represented by circumflex diacritic
and anudatta accent represented by grave accent diacritic.
These versions of slp1_roman.xml and roman_slp1.xml are
saved here for possible historical interest.

In September 2022, CDSL changes to use
svarita accent with grave accent diacritic
anudAtta accent with macron-below.
These are in the versions of slp1_roman.xml and roman_slp1.xml
in the parent directory.

See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/issues/140 for some discussion.
